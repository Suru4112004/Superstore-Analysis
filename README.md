# Superstore-Analysis

Introduction
This project analyzes a superstore dataset to extract meaningful insights related to sales, profits, customer behavior, and regional performance. The dataset is stored in a MySQL database, and Python is used to query, process, and visualize the data.

Objectives
Retrieve and analyze sales data from a MySQL database.
Perform data cleaning and preprocessing using Pandas.
Generate visualizations to uncover key sales trends and customer insights.
Identify regional sales performance and profitability trends.
Provide data-driven recommendations for business growth.

Key Analysis & Visualizations
Sales and Profit Trends: Time-series analysis to identify revenue and profit patterns.
Product Category Insights: Bar charts showing sales distribution across different product categories.
Regional Performance: Heatmaps and geographic trends of sales across various locations.
Customer Behavior Analysis: Identifying purchase frequency and customer segmentation.
